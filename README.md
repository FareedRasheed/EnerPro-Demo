Enerpro is an HVAC and energy auditing software built to assist consultants with on-site data collection. 
Typically during an on-site HVAC or energy audit, a consultant will take notes by hand before digitally combining their notes later at their desk.
Enerpro aims to accelerate the consulting process by offering real-time data collection and organization for site information.

This demo was built as a quick MVP prototype to showcase the concept of our idea. It was used during meetings with potential clients and consulting firms so we could validate our idea and flesh out our understanding on the problem. This demo was built using kotlin and android studio to showcase the organization of data and the collection process. 

Moving forward, we are planning to integrate real-time object detection to analyze and organize pieces of equipment during the consulting process.
Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of developing AI to analyze engineering drawings of site maps to visually organize data.

Enerpro is an ongoing project developed by my brother and I. Between school and work we are continuely making improvements so stay tuned!
